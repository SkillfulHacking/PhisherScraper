This is a script to automate the scraping of webpages and storing them in a php 
file to later displayed.  Currently you have to edit the generated php file 
such that the POST action in the form you are trying to capture calls login.php
User credentials are stored in phishedpasswd.txt admin.php lets you enter the 
URL of the page you want to copy and the name of the php file it will generate.
There is still much work to be done.
